# FlashBooks üìö
FlashBooks is a dynamic web application that allows users to create a temporary collection of books. Users can add a book's title, author, and description to the list. 
However, the list is not stored permanently, and it resets every time the page is refreshed. 
This project offers a quick and simple way to track books you‚Äôre interested in, all without a database, and is built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
